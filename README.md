# 2017-2018IntroPython
The lease on the macbooks is up in a few days, so I want to upload some of my old projects that I could find for nostalgia

The right now the two projects are an enigma machine and game pack I made in 9th grade. The enigma machine is self explanatory,
so I will only talk about the game pack. The games are snake, dodger and black jack, and to start it run "start.py" (it requires
pygame and python 3). The games keep track of your highscore and work fairly well, but sometimes the quit button acts up.

The game pack is a bit of spaghetti code, but it brings back good memories
